                <h1>Proposed solutions:</h1>
                <p>&emsp; Here are some solutions that we believe will further increase safety on railroads around for pedestrians:</p>
            <br>
        <ul>
            <div class="listitem">
                <h3>Sensor on crossway</h3>
                <p>&emsp; A camera with image recognition software will recognize if there is an obstruction. It will notify approaching trains of the obstruction, and if the obstruction remains on the rails for an extended period, it will suggest the conductor brake. </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="listitem">
                <h3>A faster gate</h3>
                <p>&emsp; A faster gate will discourage reckless drivers from trying to race it, reducing the probability of cars getting stuck on the rails.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="listitem">
                <h3>Increased Railroad Safety Education</h3>
                <p>&emsp; An increased emphasis on railroad safety practices on driving courses and exams can better educate new drivers on how to properly handle railroad crossings.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="listitem">
                <h3>Allow local governments to have a say over railroads in their area</h3>
                <p>&emsp; While railroads are a problem, local governments can help by arranging plans necessary to make the local railroad safer, and make sure that the community within can adjust to such changes!</p>
            </div>
            <h1>With these solutions in mind, we believe that we can achieve safer standards, to make sure that no one gets hurt by another train!</h1>
